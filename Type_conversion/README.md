# Type Conversion

## Implicit Conversion:
Python automatically converts one data type to another. This is known as implicit type conversion.

## Explicit Conversion:
Python users convert the data type of an object to required data type. 
We use the built-in functions like `int()`, `float()`, `str()`, etc to perform explicit type conversion.
This type of conversion is also called typecasting because the user casts (changes) the data type of the objects.
